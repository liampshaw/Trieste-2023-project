# R-M sites in plasmids

This repository was created during a group project as part of the EMBO workshop on 'Plasmids as vehicles of AMR spread', ICTP, Trieste, September 18-22 2023. 

It is currently a work-in-progress. We investigated the density of palindromes in core and accessory genes of five different plasmid taxonomic units (PTUs).
